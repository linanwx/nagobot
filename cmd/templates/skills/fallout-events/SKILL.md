# Fallout RPG — Random Events System

## Using the Game Engine

```
exec: python3 scripts/fallout_game.py loot [tier] [count]
exec: python3 scripts/fallout_game.py npc-gen [count]
exec: python3 scripts/fallout_game.py enemy-add <template>
exec: python3 scripts/fallout_game.py enemy-add <name> <template>
```

- Random events and weather are auto-generated by the `turn` command (10% event chance per turn, weather on new day)
- Loot tiers: `junk`, `common`, `uncommon`, `rare`, `unique`

---

## When to Trigger Random Events

| Situation | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| Traveling between locations | Every 2 turns on the road |
| Exploring a new building | On entry |
| Resting/camping | Once during rest |
| Players are indecisive | Break the deadlock with an event |
| Narrative lull | Every 3 turns without significant action |

## Encounter Resolution Guide

### Combat Encounters

When a combat encounter is generated:
1. Describe the enemy appearance (1-2 sentences)
2. Give players a chance to react (fight, flee, negotiate)
3. If fighting: `enemy-add` each enemy (auto-enters combat mode on first enemy) → `initiative` → turn-based combat
4. Player turns: `check` → `damage` → `enemy-hurt`
5. Enemy turns: `enemy-attack <enemy> <target>`
6. `turn` after all units acted → advances combat round, ticks effects
7. Last enemy killed → auto-exits to exploration mode (loot auto-rolls on kill)

**Enemy Stat Blocks** (use with `enemy-add <template>`):

| Tier | Enemy | HP | Damage | Atk | Drops | Special |
|------|-------|-----|--------|-----|-------|---------|
| 1 | Radroach | 10 | 1d6 | 8 | junk | — |

**Example enemy-add commands**:
```
enemy-add Radroach
enemy-add "Raider 1" Raider
enemy-add "Super Mutant"
enemy-add Deathclaw
```

**Enemy behavior patterns**:
- **Aggressive** (Raiders/Mutants): Attack on sight, pursue fleeing players
- **Territorial** (Deathclaws/Scorpions): Attack near nest, won't chase far
- **Swarm** (Radroaches/Ghouls): Dangerous when 3+, may flee when 1 left
- **Mechanical** (Robots/Turrets): Fixed attack patterns, can be hacked or disabled

**Encounter scaling**: The engine enforces a per-chapter encounter budget (tier limits, HP budget scaled by player count, safe turns). See `fallout-rules` skill for details.

### NPC Encounters

When an NPC encounter is generated:
1. Give them a name, appearance, motive (see fallout-story skill)
2. They should offer ONE of: trade, information, quest, warning
3. Determine their true disposition based on context and narrative judgment

### Exploration Encounters

When a location/item encounter is generated:
1. Describe the discovery
2. Check if there's a skill check needed (Lockpick, Science, etc.)
3. On success: generate loot
4. On failure: minor consequence or try again later

### Hazard Encounters

When a hazard is generated:
1. Describe the danger
2. Required skill check to avoid
3. Failure consequence: HP damage, radiation, lost items
4. Success: safe passage, maybe find something useful
